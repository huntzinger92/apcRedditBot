The revolt began on August 22nd, 1791, and Haiti didn't achieve independence from France until this day in 1804. The Haitian Revolution was the only slave uprising that led to the founding of a state which was both free from slavery, and ruled by non-whites and former captives.\n\nThe revolt began when thousands of slaves began to kill their masters and plunged the colony into civil war after a well-attended vodou ceremony. Within the next ten days, slaves had taken control of the entire Northern Province in an unprecedented slave revolt. The slaves sought revenge on their masters through \"pillage, rape, torture, mutilation, and death\". Over 200,000 black people died from the initial uprising until independence.\n\nToussaint Louverture was a notable military leader of the revolution, but died shortly before independence was won. His former lieutenant Jean-Jacques Dessalines became the first leader of the newly independent nation on this day in 1804.","link":"https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/haitian-revolution-1791-1804/","infoSrc":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution"}],"Rebellion":[{"category":"Rebellion","date":"January 1st, 1994","title":"Zapatista Uprising (1994)","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/Events/zapatistaUprising.jpg","description":"On this day in 1994, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN), an armed indigenous organization, declared war on the Mexican Government, demanding \"work, land, housing, food, health, education, independence, liberty, democracy, justice and peace.\" This action was taken at least partly in response to the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was perceived as a threat to the lives of indigenous people in Chiapas.\n\nFollowing this war declaration, armed indigenous rebels seized four towns in Chiapas, Mexico, releasing nearly 200 predominantly indigenous prisoners and destroying land records.

His activities were met with threats of reprisal by the white community, and Lee became one of the movement's earliest victims to white violence.

Despite this perception, modern historians note that he had not exacted revenge for his brother's murder at the hands of a settler and rival tribe, and had saved at least one settler's life in a raid, suggesting Dundalli had adopted a more conciliatory policy of moderation rather than \"savage\" violence.\n\nIn 1854, Dundalli entered Brisbane to be paid for removing a felled tree, and was arrested by the police.

In The Confessions of a Revolutionary, Proudhon asserted that \"Anarchy is Order Without Power\", the phrase which much later inspired in the view of some the anarchist circled-A symbol, today \"one of the most common graffiti on the urban landscape\".\n\nIt is worth noting that, despite his egalitarian beliefs in other respects, Proudhon was an avowed sexist and anti-semite. One notorious (unpublished) quote reads \"The Jew is the enemy of the human race.

In 1965, he helped organize the Selma to Montgomery marches. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty, capitalism, and the Vietnam War.\n\nFor his activism, he was the target of multiple assassination attempts, arrested 23 times, and surveilled and harassed by the police. In particular, FBI Director J.

King traveled the country to assemble \"a multiracial army of the poor\" that would march on Washington to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol until Congress created an \"economic bill of rights\" for poor Americans.\n\nBefore the plans for the march could come to fruition, however, King was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee while supporting striking black sanitation workers.

Itō also translated anarchist writings into Japanese, including works of Emma Goldman.\n\nOn September 16th, 1923, Itō, Ōsugi, and his 6-year-old nephew Munekazu were arrested, strangled to death, and thrown into an abandoned well by a squad of military police known as the \"Kenpeitai\". The killing of such high-profile anarchists, together with a young child, became a national controversy known as the \"Amakasu Incident\" (named after the leader of the squad). Lt. Amakasu was arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison for the murders, however he was released after serving only three years.","link":"https://libcom.org/history/articles/1895-1923-ito-noe","infoSrc":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%C5%8D_Noe"}],"Assassinations":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Other":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}]},"1-22":{"Revolution":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Rebellion":[{"category":"Rebellion","date":"January 22nd, 1932","title":"La Matanza (1932)","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/Events/laMatanza.jpg","description":"La Matanza (\"The Massacre\") was a peasant and communist uprising that occurred in the El Salvador on this day in 1932.

Over 30,000 indigenous people were killed at what was to be a \"peaceful meeting\" in 1932; this became known as \"La Matanza\" (\"The Slaughter\").\n\nFor his role in the uprising, Martí was executed by Salvadoran President Hernández Martínez.","link":"https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/la-matanza","infoSrc":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farabundo_Mart%C3%AD"}],"Other":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}]},"2-2":{"Revolution":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Rebellion":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Labor":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Birthdays":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Assassinations":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Other":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}]},"2-3":{"Revolution":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Rebellion":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Labor":[{"category":"Labor","date":"February 3rd, 1919","title":"54-48 Strike (1919)","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"On this day in 1919, between 17,000 and 30,000 immigrant workers walked out of mills throughout Lawrence, Massachusetts and began the '54-48' strike.

He believed that workers of all ethnicities should be united, and favored direct action over political action.\n\nHaywood was renowned for leading strikes in times of crisis. When martial law was declared during the Lawrence Textile Strike, Haywood traveled to the strike and implemented many innovative tactics to help the workers involved. One such ploy was to very publicly send the hungry children of striking workers to host families in other states, garnering good press for the working families.\n\nIn 1917, Big Bill Haywood was arrested for espionage, along with 164 other members of the IWW.

The Nashville sit-ins ended on May 10th, when six downtown stores began serving black customers for the first time.","link":"https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/nashville-sit-ins-1960/","infoSrc":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_sit-ins"}],"Labor":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Birthdays":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Assassinations":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Other":[{"category":"Other","date":"February 13th, 1991","title":"Amiriyah Shelter Bombing (1991)","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/Events/amiriyahBombing.jpg","description":"The Amiriyah Shelter Bombing was an aerial attack during the Persian Gulf War that killed at least four hundred and eight civilians on this day in 1991, when an air-raid shelter in the Amiriyah neighborhood of Baghdad was destroyed by the U.S. Air Force with two laser-guided \"smart bombs\".\n\nThe shelter was used in the Iran-Iraq War and the Persian Gulf War by hundreds of civilians.

This group was among the earliest to use the effective \"sit-down\" strike, which involved sitting down on the job and refusing to work as a bargaining measure. On this day in 1936, a large picket strike known as the Akron Rubber Strike began.\n\nThe catalyst for the strike was a round of layoffs that put 700 people out of work a Goodyear plant. Throughout the strike, there were as many as 10,000 workers that picketed around the many gates of the Goodyear factory. Police were unable to enforce an injuction against mass picketing because of the size of the crowd. A private force of about 5,200 people, known as the \"Law and Order League\", financially funded by Goodyear, and managed by a former mayor of Akron, were prepared to attack the striking workers if told to do so.\n\nThe Summit County Central Labor Council was able to convince the Law and Order League to not attack the striking workers, and violence was averted. The Council also threatened a general strike if there were violent attacks on picketing workers, further dissauding anti-strike attacks. After a month of striking, the workers won their terms and the sit-down strike quickly spread to other parts of the auto industry.","link":"https://libcom.org/history/akron-rubber-workers-struggles-1933-1936-jeremy-brecher","infoSrc":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron_rubber_strike_of_1936#Picket_strike_of_February%E2%80%93March_1936"}],"Birthdays":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Assassinations":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Other":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}]},"2-15":{"Revolution":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Rebellion":[{"category":"Rebellion","date":"February 15th, 1968","title":"Folsom Prison Strike (1968)","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"On this day in 1968, one fifth of San Quentin's prison population of 3900 risked the Warden's threat of an additional year behind bars by returning to their cells after breakfast, engaging in a work stoppage.

Shouting \"Down with Guizot\" and \"Long Live the Reform\", the crowds marched past Guizot's residence and erected barricades in the streets of Paris, where fighting broke out between the citizens and the Parisian municipal guards.\n\nIn the next few days, Guizot resigned and King Phillipp fled the country. On February 23rd, French troops fired into a crowd of protesters, killing 52. By February 26th, the Second Republic had been formed, with poet Alphonse de Lamartine acting as a de facto dictator over France for the next three months.\n\nThe Second Republic's governance would be tested in the \"June Days\" uprising, which Karl Marx identified as a conflict between petite bourgeoisie and the proletariat.

Borrowing a phrase from Frederick Douglass, he popularized the use of the term \"color line\" to represent the injustice of the separate but equal doctrine prevalent in American social and political life.\n\nDu Bois believed that capitalism was a primary cause of racism, and he was generally sympathetic to socialist causes throughout his life. Because of this, he was spied upon by the U.S. government, who eventually indicted him for acting as an agent of a foreign state while advocating for nuclear disarmament.

On this day in 1955, she was arrested at the age of fifteen in Montgomery, Alabama for refusing to give up her seat to a white woman on a crowded, segregated bus. This occurred nine months before the more widely known incident in which Rosa Parks, secretary of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), helped spark the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.\n\nFor many years, Montgomery's black leaders did not publicize Colvin's pioneering effort. She was an unmarried teenager at the time, and was reportedly impregnated by a married man. It is widely accepted that Colvin was not accredited by the civil rights campaigners at the time due to her pregnancy shortly after the incident, with even Rosa Parks saying \"If the white press got ahold of that information, they would have [had] a field day. They'd call her a bad girl, and her case wouldn't have a chance.\"\n\nColvin left Montgomery for New York City in 1958, because she had difficulty finding and keeping work following her participation in the federal court case that overturned bus segregation (similarly, Rosa Parks left Montgomery for Detroit in 1957). Colvin stated she was branded a troublemaker by many in her community.

With help from the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the case was appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court, which affirmed seven of the eight convictions. The cases were then appealed twice to the United States Supreme Court, which ordered new trials due to the exclusion of black people from juries (Norris v. Alabama) and violation of due process (Powell v. Alabama).\n\nIn the subsequent re-trials, Creed Conyer was selected as the first black person since Reconstruction to sit on an Alabama grand jury. Despite the successful legal appeals, most of the Scottsboro Boys were convicted on charges of rape or sexual assault.

Together, they seized strategically important buildings in Dublin and proclaimed an Irish Republic.\n\nThe Easter Rising lasted for six days and killed nearly 500 people, wounding 2,600 more. Sixteen of the Rising's leaders were executed in May 1916, but the insurrection, the nature of the executions, and subsequent political developments ultimately contributed to an increase in popular support for Irish independence.","link":"http://www.easter1916.net/","infoSrc":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Rising"}],"Rebellion":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Labor":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Birthdays":[{"category":"Birthdays","date":"April 24th, 1954","title":"Mumia Abu-Jamal (1954 - )","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/Individuals/mumiaJamal.jpg","description":"Mumia Abu-Jamal is a political activist and journalist who was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1982 for the murder of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner.

On Feburary 25th, 1920, he was arrested, held without any allowed communication or trial for eight weeks, and beaten. On this day that year, his body was discovered on the ground outside the office where he was held, presumably having fallen 14 stories.

They shouted such slogans as \"struggle for the sovereignty externally, get rid of the national traitors at home\", \"do away with the Twenty-One Demands\", and \"don't sign the Versailles Treaty\".\n\nThe next day, students in Beijing as a whole went on strike and in the larger cities across China, students, patriotic merchants, and workers joined protests. The demonstrators skillfully appealed to the newspapers and sent representatives to carry the word across the country. In Shanghai, a general strike of merchants and workers nearly devastated the entire Chinese economy.\n\nIn the years that followed, many Chinese political thinkers turned to leftist politics in the wake of the political upheaval of the May 4th Movement.

The bomb blast and ensuing gunfire resulted in the deaths of seven police officers, four to eight civilians, and wounded approximately one hundred people on either side.\n\nIn the internationally publicized legal proceedings that followed, eight anarchists were convicted of conspiracy. Seven were sentenced to death and one to a term of 15 years in prison. Illinois Governor Richard J. Oglesby commuted two of the sentences to terms of life in prison; another committed suicide in jail rather than face the gallows. The other four were hanged on November 11th, 1887.\n\nAmong supporters of the labor movement in the United States and abroad and others, the trial was widely believed to have been unfair, and even a serious miscarriage of justice.

This was fueled by serious problems of landlessness in the Kikuyu reserves, which were pushing out increasing numbers of ahoi. The land litigation cases that followed, especially in Kiambu, saw the losers becoming either workers in their former lands, now owned by the growing elite of commercial farmers, or simply leaving for Nairobi.\n\nOn the morning of May 15th, Fred Kubai and Makhan Singh, leaders in the East African Trades Union Congress (EATCU), were arrested by and charged with being officers of an unregistered trade union refusing to dissolve within the three month notification period. Later that day members of the EATCU declared a general strike to begin the following day, but by evening a general strike was already in effect all over Nairobi.\n\nThe strike paralyzed airport travel, public services, and greatly limited commcercial business. In a puzzling decision, strike leadership called off the strike after a week's worth of protest, disseminating a return-to-work order for May 25th. In the aftermath of the strike, the power of trade unions was diminished with the government arresting thousands of their members.

Foster was the more radical of the two, while Browder endorsed Roosevelt's \"New Deal\" and was more politically accomodating.\n\nBrowder was the chairman of CPUSA when the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (an agreement of non-agression between Soviets and Nazis), and almost overnight the Party changed from being militantly anti-fascist to only engaging in moderate criticism of Germany. CPUSA's membership declined by 15% in the following year.\n\nBrowder was an advocate for a co-operative relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States after World War II, and was sharply criticized by the French Communist Party (later revealed to have been done so on orders from Moscow) in the \"Duclos Letter\". Due to the domestic Red Scare in the U.S. and his ambitions of co-operative clashing with the Soviet agenda, Browder was expelled from the Communist Party on February 5th, 1946.","link":"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Earl-Browder","infoSrc":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Browder"}],"Assassinations":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Other":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}]},"5-21":{"Revolution":[{"category":"Revolution","date":"May 21st, 1871","title":"Paris Commune Dissolves (1871)","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/Events/parisCommune.jpg","description":"The Paris Commune was a radical socialist and revolutionary government that formed in Paris on March 18th, 1871.

Among these policies were the separation of church and state, abolition of child labor, abolishment of interest on some forms of debt, as well as the right of employees to take over and run an enterprise if it was deserted by its original owner.\n\nThe Paris Commune was analyzed by many communist thinkers, most notably Karl Marx, who called it a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" Vladimir Lenin danced in the snow when the newly formed Bolshevik goverment lasted longer than the Paris Commune. It inspired similar revolutionary attempts around the world, including in Moscow (1905), Petrograd (1917), Shanghai (1927 and 1967), and Seattle (2020).","link":"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/05/kristin-ross-communal-luxury-paris-commune/","infoSrc":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune"}],"Rebellion":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Labor":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Birthdays":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Assassinations":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Other":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}]},"5-22":{"Revolution":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Rebellion":[{"category":"Rebellion","date":"May 22nd, 2012","title":"Dawoud al-Marhoon Arrested (2012)","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/Individuals/dawoudAlMarhoon.jpg","description":"Dawoud Al Marhoon (1995 - ) is a Saudi Arabian who, as a teenager, participated in the Saudi Arabian protests during the Arab Spring.

Most of the victims were recent Italian and Jewish immigrant women and girls aged 14 to 23.\n\nThe death toll was high in part because the doors to the stairwells and exits were locked (a then-common practice to prevent workers from taking unauthorized breaks and to reduce theft).

Bakunin's prestige as an activist also made him one of the most famous ideologues in Europe, gaining substantial influence among radicals throughout Russia and Europe.\n\nBakunin is remembered as a major figure in the history of anarchism, an opponent of Marxism, especially of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and for his predictions that Marxist regimes would be one-party dictatorships over the proletariat, not by the proletariat. His book, God and the State, has been widely translated and remains in print. Bakunin continues to influence anarchists such as Noam Chomsky.\n\nIt is worth noting that Bakunin espoused anti-Semitic views in some of his works, writing \"...and where there is centralisation of the state, there must necessarily be a central bank, and where such a bank exists, the parasitic Jewish nation, speculating with the labor of the people, will be found.\"\n\nHis biographer Mark Leier wrote that, \"Bakunin had a significant influence on later thinkers, ranging from Peter Kropotkin and Errico Malatesta to the Wobblies and Spanish anarchists in the Civil War to Herbert Marcuse, E.P. Thompson, Neil Postman, and A.S. Neill, down to the anarchists gathered these days under the banner of 'anti-globalization.'\"","link":"https://theanarchistlibrary.org/category/author/mikhail-bakunin","infoSrc":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin"},{"category":"Birthdays","date":"May 30th, 1886","title":"Randolph Bourne (1886 - 1918)","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/Individuals/randolphBourne.jpg","description":"Randolph Silliman Bourne, born on this day in 1918, was a progressive writer, disability advocate, and pacifist born in Bloomfield, New Jersey and a graduate of Columbia University.

As a delegation of 130 black New Orleans residents marched behind the U.S. flag toward the Mechanics Institute, Mayor John T.

The war was triggered by a German policy designed to force the indigenous population to grow cotton for export, and it lasted from 1905 to 1907.\n\nIn the days leading up to the rebellion, a spirit medium named Kinjikitile Ngwale developed a belief that the people of German East Africa had been called upon to eliminate the Germans.

His memoir, You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train (Beacon Press, 2002), was also the title of a 2004 documentary about Zinn's life and work.

More than half of the CTA's bus drivers were African-American and for weeks they had been fighting what they considered unfair union representation.\n\nLike many other protest movements in the 50s and 60s, the drivers took as their model the Montgomery bus boycott, organizing car pools and CTW \"courtesy cars\" to meet the transporation shortfall in some neighborhoods.

The white drivers at the white ones did not.\"\n\nAccording to Willis, the strike's failure was due to the collective effort of establishment political powers working against the strike: \"With the police arresting our guys, the judges putting guys in jail and holding them for contempt, and the union threatening to kick our leaders out, it was a pretty concerted attack.

The dispute is often viewed as the most severe and significant industrial dispute in Irish history.\n\nIn the years leading up to the strike, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU) had been seeking to unionize and radicalize the Irish workforce. Founded by socialist revolutionary James Larkin in 1908, the ITGWU was the first Irish union to cater to both skilled and unskilled workers.\n\nIn July 1913, three hundred businesses (led by capitalist William Martin Murphy) agreed to not allow the ITGWU to unionize the Dublin workers. Murphy dismissed hundreds of workers of suspected of union membership soon after. Employers in Dublin then locked out their workers, affecting tens of thousands of Irish workers, many of whom were already the poorest in the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter outbreaks of violence between striking workers and strike-breakers, James Connolly, Larkin and ex-British Army Captain Jack White formed a worker's militia, the Irish Citizen Army, to protect workers' demonstrations.\n\nThe lock-out eventually concluded in early 1914, when the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in Britain rejected Larkin and Connolly's request for a sympathetic strike. Most workers, many of whom were on the brink of starvation, went back to work and signed pledges not to join the ITGWU.","link":"https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-dublin-1913-lockout/","infoSrc":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_lock-out"}],"Birthdays":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Assassinations":[{"category":"Assassinations","date":"August 26th, 1919","title":"Fannie Sellins (1872 - 1919)","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/Individuals/fannieSellins.jpg","description":"Fannie Sellins was an American union organizer who was murdered by deputies policing a picket line on this day in 1919.\n\nSellins came to the attention of United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) after helping organize a local chapter of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union in St. Louis, negotiating a worker lockout at a garment factory.

The riots were in protest of agricultural mechanization (which displaced workers) and harsh working conditions. They began with the destruction of threshing machines in the Elham Valley area of East Kent in the summer of 1830, and by early December had spread through the whole of southern England and East Anglia, also destroying workhouses, tithe barns, ricks (hay bales), and maiming cows.\n\nHistorian J. F. C. Harrison concluded that the riots were overwhelmingly the result of the progressive impoverishment and dispossession of the English agricultural workforce over the previous fifty years. The name \"Swing Riots\" was derived from the pseudonym \"Captain Swing\", often signed to the threatening letters sent to farmers, magistrates, parsons, and others. The term \"swing\" was apparently a reference to the swinging stick of the flail used in hand threshing, and Captain Swing was regarded as the mythical figurehead of the rebellion.\n\nThe Swing Riots were a major influence on the Whig Government and, as a part of a wider chain of social unrest, helped pressure the government to pass the Reform Act 1832, the \"Poor Law Amendment Act\" of 1834, which ended \"outdoor relief\" in cash or kind, and the setting up of a chain of workhouses covering larger areas across the country, to which the poor had to go if they wanted help.","link":"https://libcom.org/history/captain-swing-was-here","infoSrc":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_Riots"}],"Labor":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Birthdays":[{"category":"Birthdays","date":"August 28th, 1825","title":"Karl Ulrichs (1825 - 1895)","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/Individuals/karlUlrichs.jpg","description":"Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, born on this day in 1825, was a German lawyer, journalist, and author who is seen today as a pioneer of the modern gay rights movement.

The FBI tried to subvert his activities in Chicago, sowing disinformation among these groups and placing a counterintelligence operative in the local Panthers. In December 1969, Hampton was assassinated during a predawn raid at his Chicago apartment by the Chicago Police Department. During the raid, Panther Mark Clark was also killed.\n\nAt a press conference the next day, the police announced the arrest team had been attacked by the \"violent\" and \"extremely vicious\" Panthers, and had defended themselves accordingly.

At its height about 600,000 workers were involved.\n\nThe worker rebellion was the culmination of years of labor strife - weeks before the occupations, the Italian Federation of Metalurgical Workers (FIOM), the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), and the General Confederation of Labor (CGL) called for \"obstructionism\" (essentially, a work slowdown) to be applied in all the engineering factories and shipyards starting on August 21st.\n\nBy the 24th, production at the Romeo factory in Milan came to a complete standstill. A week later, production at the FIAT-Centro plant was reduced by 60%. On the morning of the 30th, the 2000 workers of the Romeo plant found the gates locked and the factory surrounded by troops. The FIOM responded by calling on its members to occupy the 300 engineering factories in Milan. Historian Lynn Williams describes what happened next:\n\n\"Between the 1st and 4th of September metal workers occupied factories throughout the Italian peninsula...the occupations rolled forward not only in the industrial heartland around Milan, Turin and Genoa but in Rome, Florence, Naples and Palermo, in a forest of red and black flags and a fanfare of workers bands...Within three days 400,000 workers were in occupation. As the movement spread to other sectors, the total rose to over half a million.\"\n\nAlthough some radical elements within the workers' movement (Antonio Gramsci, the Italian Syndicalist Union) called for revolution, referring to the occupations as \"an expropriating general strike\" and demanding total socialization of the economy, more moderate forces (the CGL) prevailed, using the pressure of the rebellion to cut a deal with employers, granting better conditions to the workers on the condition of returning to work.","link":"https://www.marxist.com/italy-lost-revolution091002.htm","infoSrc":"http://www.workerscontrol.net/theorists/italian-factory-occupations-1920"}],"Labor":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Birthdays":[{"category":"Birthdays","date":"September 1st, 1907","title":"Walter Reuther (1907 - 1970)","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/Individuals/walterReuther.jpg","description":"Walter Philip Reuther, born on this day in 1907, was an American leader of organized labor and civil rights activist who built the United Automobile Workers (UAW) into one of the most progressive labor unions in American history.

Initially regarded as governor-general, Dessalines was later named Emperor of Haiti as Jacques I (1804-1806) by the generals of the Haitian Revolution Army. He is regarded as one of the founding fathers of Haiti.\n\nAs the slave rebellions developed into a revolutionary movement, he served as principal lieutenant to the movement's leader, Toussaint Louverture, helping lead the Haitian armies to many victories in battle over the French.\n\nAfter Louverture's betrayal and death, Dessalines became the leader of the Haitian Revolution in 1802, eventually leading the colony to its independence. In 1804, he ordered mass killings of all the French remaining on the island, leading to the deaths of 3000-5000 French people of all ages and sexes.\n\nAfter achieving freedom from France, Dessalines imposed a strict regimen of labor on the Haitian population, leading to widespread resentment of his rule. Eventually, he was assassinated by his own people in 1806, leading to civil war on the island.","link":"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jean-Jacques-Dessalines","infoSrc":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Dessalines"}],"Assassinations":[{"category":"Assassinations","date":"September 20th, 1972","title":"Richard Oakes (1942 - 1972)","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/Individuals/richardOakes.jpg","description":"Richard Oakes was a Mohawk Native American activist.

While there, Bishop acquired a law degree and studied the works of Lenin, Mao Zedong, and Julius Nyerere.\n\nIn 1970, he returned to Grenada and was active politically, representing striking nurses in court and leading the \"New Jewel Movement\", which ultimately put him in power. In 1979, the New Jewel Movement successfully led a coup against Eric Gairy and made Bishop the Prime Minister of Grenada.\n\nAmong Bishop's core principles were workers' rights, women's rights, and the struggle against racism and apartheid. Women were given equal pay and paid maternity leave, and sex discrimination was made illegal. organizations for education, health care, youth affairs, and literacy were also established. Due to his efforts, illiteracy and unemployment greatly declined.\n\nIn 1983, disputes within the party culminated in Bishop, along with seven members of his cabinet, being captured and executed.

On July 14th, armed miners surrounded the stockades where leased convicts were held and sent them by train out of the city.\n\nAfter repeated attacks on mine property and the stockades where the prisoners were being kept, it was on this day in 1891 when the miners finally burned the stockades to the ground and freed the hundreds of convicts being held there. On Nov. 2nd, another band attacked stockades in a different location and freed those prisoners as well.

Approximately 215 people were indicted under the legislation, including alleged communists, anarchists, and fascists.\n\nOne this day in 1949, the first trial of communist leaders began in Manhattan, New York.

The group claimed that, under the Treaty of Fort Laramie between the U.S. and the Lakota tribe, all retired, abandoned, or out-of-use federal land was returned to the Indians who once occupied it.\n\nBy late May of 1971, the government had cut off all electrical power and all telephone service to the island. Left without power, fresh water, and in the face of diminishing public support and sympathy, the number of occupiers began to dwindle. On June 11th, 1971, a large force of federal officers removed the remaining 15 people from the island.","link":"https://www.kqed.org/news/11788540/a-look-back-at-the-occupation-of-alcatraz-50-years-later","infoSrc":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Alcatraz"}],"Labor":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Birthdays":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Assassinations":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Other":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}]},"11-10":{"Revolution":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Rebellion":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Labor":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Birthdays":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Assassinations":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Other":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}]},"11-11":{"Revolution":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Rebellion":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Labor":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Birthdays":[{"category":"Birthdays","date":"November 11th, 1914","title":"Daisy Bates (1914 - 1999)","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/Individuals/daisyBates.jpg","description":"Daisy Bates was an American civil rights activist, publisher, journalist, and lecturer who played a leading role in the Little Rock Integration Crisis of 1957.

In response, the membership of the \"White Citizen's Council\" dramatically increased.\n\nMany acts of terrorism were committed by whites in response to the boycott - the homes of Martin Luther King Jr. and Ralph Abernathy were firebombed, boycotters were often physically attacked, and dozens of activists were arrested.\n\nThe boycott ended on December 20th of 1956, when the city passed an ordinance allowing black members to sit where they wanted on the bus. The campaign of white terrorism continued, however, and all within the month that followed integration on buses, multiple churches were bombed, buses were subject to sniper fire, and at least one black man was lynched.","link":"https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/montgomery-bus-boycott-1955-56/","infoSrc":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_bus_boycott"}],"Labor":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Birthdays":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Assassinations":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Other":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}]},"12-6":{"Revolution":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Rebellion":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Labor":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Birthdays":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Assassinations":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Other":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}]},"12-7":{"Revolution":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Rebellion":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Labor":[{"category":"","date":"","title":"","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/empty.jpg","description":"","link":"","infoSrc":""}],"Birthdays":[{"category":"Birthdays","date":"December 7th, 1928","title":"Noam Chomsky (1928 - )","imgSrc":"./assets/eventPhotos/Individuals/noamChomsky.jpg","description":"Avram Noam Chomsky is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, social critic, and political activist.

The Cherokee Nation sued the state of Georgia and lost; on appeal, the Supreme Court declined to rule on the case.\n\nA year later, the Supreme Court ruled that the Cherokee Nation was a sovereign entity and that the Georgia laws were illegal, however President Andrew Jackson flagrantly violated this ruling and ordered the expulsion of the Cherokee Nation.
